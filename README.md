# checkbook-cobol
a checkbook program my dad and I wrote in the 1980s.

I have no idea how to compile it. I think GNU Cobol can compile it but I did notice it has SCREEN SECTION stuff.

Likely it was written for Nevada/Utah COBOL (from Ellis Computing) and migrated to IBM COBOL. Again, not sure.

I'm uploading it as an example of a small but useful (as I recall) Checkbook program.
